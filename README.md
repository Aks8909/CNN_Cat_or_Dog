# CNN_Cat_or_Dog
Hi! in this ML project I have made a simple dog or cat classifier using CNN<br/>

<p>In machine learning, CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. It is a type 
of artificial neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as 
images. CNNs are particularly effective in tasks related to computer vision, image 
recognition, and pattern analysis.

I have just uploaded the code and not the dataset as the dataset consists of about
8000 images in the training set and 2000 images in the test set which takes a lot
of space.
